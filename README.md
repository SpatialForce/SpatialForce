This project is still on very early stage.
**But if you like it, please let's discuss it through issue or pull request!**

If you'd like to compile by you own. here is the step.
1. Download vcpkg. I use vcpkg to support third_party libs. you can use Clion to install it or by your own.
   Then use vcpkg cmake toolchain like
```
cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=~/.vcpkg-clion/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```
